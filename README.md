# General
In this project we have created a software that allows the user to create and manage projects and activities. 

It contains all the necessary files to run the cucumber tests and running the GUI.


# Running the Cucumber tests
The tests can be run through the class CucumberTest in the package Cucumber.test in the folder 'test/java/Cucumber.test'
When right-clicking and pressing the button "Run:CucumberTest" the tests will run automatically.

# Running the GUI
To run the Graphical User Interface, one must go to the folder src/main/java/application/View. Then as with the cucumber test,
right-click and press the button "Run:View". The GUI will then start.
OBS: The initial password to login is "test", once in the program it is possible to create a new user with an Id, it has to be 4 letters
OBS: The program is not fully functional, and some features are not implemented yet.
